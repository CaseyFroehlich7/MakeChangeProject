 # Make Change Project

 ### Description
The Cash Register is a program that acts as an actual cash register would operate in a store. The user is prompted to enter the price of the item, enter the amount tendered, and with that information the program should identify whether or not the customer needs change, paid with exact change, or if the customer hasn't given enough money. If the customer in fact needs change the program needs to identify how much money needs to be returned and should do so in a descriptive list of each denomination.
 ### Lessons Learned
 Throughout this homework assignment I learned the importance and overall efficiency of using keyboard shortcuts. I feel that the shortcut that saved me the most time was the "Command, Option, R" shortcut. This allowed me to rename a variable all at once saving minutes of editing. Another lesson that I learned during the cash register homework was that in order to get my division to perform correctly I had to actually flip the variables I was attempting to divide. Lastly, I found myself searching for a more efficient way when writing all of the "if" statements but although it felt repetitive, all of the conditions are different so being patient in that sometimes, repetitive code is necessary code.
